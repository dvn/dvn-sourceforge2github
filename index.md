## Introduction

The Dataverse Network Project is migrating from SourceForge to GitHub (and svn to git) as described in https://redmine.hmdc.harvard.edu/issues/1188

This guide is intended to help DVN developers transition from using svn to git and GitHub, specifically.

If you get lost in these pages, please use the breadcrumbs. :)

## Setup

The [setup](setup) page describes creating your GitHub account and managing your ssh keys.

## Demo with iqss-javaee-template

Before talking about DVN, we'll do a quick demo with a smaller and lighter example called "iqss-javaee-template" in the [demo](demo) section.
